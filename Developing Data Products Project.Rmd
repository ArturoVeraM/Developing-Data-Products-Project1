## R Markdown and Leaflet

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r, message = FALSE}

library(leaflet)

           "Casa de la Cultura de Azcapotzalco","Cafeteria el Nevado","Alameda Norte","Parque de la China",
           "Catedral de los Santos Apóstoles Felipe y Santiago"),
